## Context

**Problem**: By 2050, 50% of the world population will be myopic   , due to sustained and constant use of mobile devices

**Challenge**: Use devices as tools to communicate and inspire   people to change their behaviour, using gaming  activation

## Our Solution

We created a myopia self-assessment tool powered by a Deep Learning System, inside Apple Health, that allows all iPhone users to be aware of their eye condition, anywhere, anytime, with no cost.

Through this system, and other user behavioural factors that we can gather from their iPhones, we are also able to predict their risk of getting myopia in the future.
