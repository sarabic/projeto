## Context

**Problem**: In the era of digital communication, expressing emotions and messages creatively has become essential. However, creating personalized stickers for messaging apps like WhatsApp can be time-consuming and requires artistic skills that many users do not possess. With the increasing need for quick and unique ways to communicate, there is a gap in the market for easily accessible, custom sticker creation.

**Challenge**: While there are many pre-made sticker packs available, they lack personalization and do not always convey the specific emotions or messages users wish to share. This makes it difficult for individuals to express themselves fully and uniquely in their conversations.
