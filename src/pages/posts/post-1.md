## Context

1. **Problem**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Challenge**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

## Our Solution

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
